# GOSP - The Gamemodes Open Source Project

A (to-be) open source framework for easily building extensive mini-games on top of. Leave it up to the framework to handle lobbying, player management, spectating and the like!

Currently supports Team vs Team gamemodes on a timer + a scoring system, with support for other configurations later on!

## Currently implemented gamemodes

### Bandito Ball

A soccer match between 2 teams in RC toy cars! Who can score the most points by shooting the big ball into the enemies' goal?

### Knockdown

A match between 2 teams to stay on a platform while dodging obstacles to avoid falling off! Which team gets the highest score from the other team's misfortune?

### Hoop Da Loop

A standoff between 2 teams to collect the most points by stunting through hoops! Which team performs the most (and more importantly the most extreme) stunts?
